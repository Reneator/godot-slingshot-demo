# godot-slingshot-demo
small physics demo i made in about an hour, after learning a bit about godot physics for me current game "Progress Game".

If there are features you wanna see, just create an issue!

Maybe i will add some more features, like:
- Objects that get destroyed if they are hit hard enough
- Score-system
